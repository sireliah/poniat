# Pale Moon for Linux installer

- Version 0.2.1

---

## Using the installer

- Extract the contents of the archive to your home directory.
- Run the "pminstaller.sh" script from the file manager by double clicking on 
it. If, however, this does not work for some reason, then open a terminal 
emulator window, type the following and hit enter.

		~/pminstaller.sh

  (Assuming the "pminstaller.sh" script is placed in the home directory, as 
instructed above).
- Follow the on-screen prompts to continue.

Note:

At this time, the installer does not work with the Atom optimized builds of 
Pale Moon for Linux. You can manually download them from 
http://linux.palemoon.org/atom/
- Do not invoke the installer as root (e.g. "sudo ./pminstaller.sh"). On some 
distros, the sudo command will strip the XAUTHORITY variable (without which any 
graphical program cannot run). The installer will automatically elevate itself 
using su(do).
- If you recieve a "Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display" error when trying to 
run the installer, ensure that xhost is installed on your system then try to 
run the installer again.
- The installer may not run on some "lightweight" distributions since the 
standard command line tools use busybox (which does not implement all features 
of the required command line tools).
- If the installer does not run because the built-in copy of yad complains 
about being unable to load a particular library, then you clearly do not have 
the basic dependencies required for any recent Mozilla based product. Please 
update the related libraries and try again.
- If you have any specialized requirements that the installer does not serve 
out of the box, then please use the manual installation instructions on the 
Pale Moon for Linux site (http://linux.palemoon.org/help/installation/).
